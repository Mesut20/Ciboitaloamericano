# Example .env for server
# Copy this to .env and fill in real credentials before running in production

DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
PORT=4000
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=https://ciboitaloamericano.se

# SMTP settings: set these to a single SMTP account that is allowed to send from your domain
# This should NOT be the visitor's email. Use a site-owned mailbox like hello@ciboitaloamericano.se
SMTP_HOST=smtp.ciboitaloamericano.se
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=hello@ciboitaloamericano.se   # <-- your SMTP username
SMTP_PASS=supersecretpassword           # <-- your SMTP password
FROM_EMAIL="Cibo Italo‑Americano <hello@ciboitaloamericano.se>"

# Admin receipt for booking confirmations (keeps backup copy)
ADMIN_EMAIL=hello@ciboitaloamericano.se

# Notes:
# - The app sends two emails per booking: one to the email address the visitor enters, and one to ADMIN_EMAIL.
# - SMTP_USER/SMTP_PASS must be valid credentials for the SMTP server (or use an API-based provider).
# - If you don't have production SMTP yet, you can create a temporary Ethereal test account (developer-only) to verify email formatting.
#   To test quickly without adding credentials, ask me and I can run a one-time Ethereal send for you.
